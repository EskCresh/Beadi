# Version 0.2

To make beadi a bit more accessible to new users, there is now a welcome message, which should present an easy starting point.

Also I have made initial efforts into the direction of typed connections - especially signals! The Button node now features a way to send a signal to other nodes, e.g the Toggle node, this allows you to create more sophisticated control flows, and you don't have to fiddle around with numeric values, while you're at it.

# Version 0.1

This is the very first version of Beadi, so there's a lot of stuff - just see for yourself
